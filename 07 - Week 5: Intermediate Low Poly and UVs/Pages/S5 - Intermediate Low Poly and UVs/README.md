<h3><strong>Objective</strong></h3>
<p><span>This assignment consists of two parts:</span></p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1"><span>You will create a low poly version of your Runestone rock, UV unwrap it, bake it, and texture it.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>You will UV unwrap and bake the provided garbage can model</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Expected Outcome</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Fully textured game resolution version of your runestone rock</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Fully UVed and baked garbage can model</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Stretch Goals</strong></h3>
<p><span>If you have time, try creating your own garbage can model.</span></p>
