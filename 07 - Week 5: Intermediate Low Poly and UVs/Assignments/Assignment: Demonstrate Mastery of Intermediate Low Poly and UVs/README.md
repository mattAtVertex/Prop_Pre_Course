# Assignment: Demonstrate Mastery of Intermediate Low Poly and UVs

<h2>Mastering the Pipeline</h2>
<p>This Sprint's assignment is broken into two parts. You will be both finishing your runestone as well as UV unwrapping a provided asset.</p>

<h3>Part 1: Low Poly, UV, Bake, and Texture your Runestone</h3>

<p>For the first part, let's take the runestone from last sprint and take through the rest of the process. You will want to create the low poly, unwrap the UVs, bake it, and then texture it. We will be using this result later in the rendering phase.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;Part 2: UV and Bake a Garbage Can</h3>
<h3><img src="https://vertexschool.instructure.com/courses/172/files/10659/preview?verifier=E2rMdR08o943wbc8TynSOcjZGjbJKGwC8OvkFWXM" alt="EllieGarbageCan.png" width="400" height="225" data-api-endpoint="https://vertexschool.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/172/files/10659" data-api-returntype="File"></h3>
<p>To practice more with UVs and the baking process, you will be taking the provided garbage can and unwrapping the UVs, then baking it. You may take it all the way through the texturing stage if you wish. For a stretch goal, try making your own garbage can and taking it all the way through the process!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Required Resources</h3>
<p>Please download the following files to work on. You will be creating the UVs for the GarbageCan_LP file.</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>The following images need to be included in your post:</p>
<ul>
<li>At least 1 angle of your fully textured runestone</li>
<li>At least 1 angle of your baked garbage can</li>
<li>Screenshots of your UV layout for both the runestone and garbage can</li>
</ul>
<h3>Submission</h3>
<ol>
<li>Post your images in your designated Discord channel</li>
<li>Post link to the post by clicking "Submit" in upper right of this page.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
<p>Here are some possible stretch goals for this assignment.<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>All stretch goal images are in addition to the required images</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Try your hand at texturing the garbage can in addition to baking it.</li>
<li>Too easy? Try modeling your own garbage can or other object in both high poly and low poly. Then create the UVs and bake it.</li>
</ul>
