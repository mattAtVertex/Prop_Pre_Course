# S2 - Intro to the Texture Machine

<h1><span>Overview</span></h1>
<p><span>In this sprint, you will learn about creating authentic textures for Physically Based Rendering. You’ll be introduced to Substance Painter’s powerful toolkit that will allow you to improve your texturing workflow through the usage of variations, gradients, and curvature. You’ll then learn about adding story to your textures with history and usage details.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Objective</strong></h3>
<p><span>You’ll be taking your existing models from the previous sprint and texturing them using the Texture Machine techniques.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Expected Outcome</strong></h3>
<p><span>Your game resolution models will be fully textured with authentic PBR textures.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Stretch Goals</strong></h3>
<p><span>Try adding extra details in the texture such as stencils.</span></p>
