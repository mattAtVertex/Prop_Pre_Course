# Mindset: Blue Ocean

<p>You are walking into a competitive industry. A lot of people want the job you’re going to apply for. The best chance you have of success, though, is to not compete at all.</p>
<p>Some years ago I came across the book called the Blue Ocean Strategy. It explores innovative companies and how they structure themselves for massive growth even in competitive industries.</p>
<p>The idea is that there are two types of oceans that you can fish in. You can fish in a red ocean or a blue ocean.</p>
<p>A red ocean is competitive. There’s blood in the water. You have to claw your way for every inch of growth. For example, imagine starting a computer company today. Imagine competing against Dell or HP or Apple for the same shelf space at Best Buys across the world...</p>
<p>You have to distinguish yourself somehow but how? Do you distinguish yourself on how fast your computer runs. Well, that’s usually defined by your processor and ram and your competition has access to the same stuff you do.</p>
<p>That’s clearly a red ocean but is there a way to turn that red ocean into a blue ocean? That’s what we’re here to talk about today. To give you a bit of a hint, think about Alienware or Boxx computers. How did they distinguish themselves and build computer companies in such a competitive space? Well, one focused on VFX and the other focused on Gaming. You can even think about how Razor markets itself to a gamer crowd. Include lighted keyboards and marketing that is very much focused on individuals. Much more than Dell computers which looks like it’s orientated towards large corporations buying their stuff.</p>
<p>The good news is that while this is a competitive industry it is also an industry that changes frequently and requires skill updates every 3 to 5 years. They called this the half-life of a skill but you have to understand that not everybody that’s in the industry is going to stay in the industry. There is churn. It's a Red Ocean, after all.</p>
<p>That creates opportunity but is that enough?</p>
<p>I would argue that it is not enough. At least, not enough all by itself. Basically, it’s not enough for you to just pick up some new piece of software that everybody wants. Your job is not to just push buttons in software alone. You have to create art. Today, you have to create PBR ready assets at higher resolutions than ever before.</p>
<p>In order to give yourself the best chance of success you have to first become a job candidate. That means that you’ve got to have all the hiring triggers that they want to see. After that, you should position yourself for whatever blue ocean exist around you.</p>
<p>To help find the blue ocean you got to do a few things. The grid below gives you one example of Cirque du Soleil which completely transformed the circus industry by reimagining it.</p>

<p>When I first started teaching I was in a blue ocean and I didn’t even know it. All I knew was that I wanted to share something with the world and I got lucky. As your mentor I am less inclined to have you rely on luck. I would rather you have a strategy that helps you make your dreams come true,</p>
<p>What's the strategy?</p>
<p>Well, we have do find four things.&nbsp; That's it.&nbsp; What are the four things? We need to eliminate, reduce. raise and create.&nbsp; That's all. :)</p>
<p>Of course, the hard part is knowing what we need to eliminate... what we need to raise and what we need to create, right? So, the problem boils down to the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>What do we need to eliminate?</li>
<li>What do we need to reduce?</li>
<li>What do we need to increase/raise?</li>
<li>What do we need to create?</li>
</ol>
<p>Cirque du Soleil eliminated animals and the three rings. They created storylines.</p>
<p>What do you need to eliminate in your work? What do you need to create in your work?</p>
<p>The Cirque du Soleil example is a little misleading. Many artists think that they need to create original artwork. They have to make the concept, the 3-D model… They probably should invent their own 3-D software… And while they’re at it they might as well develop their own processor so that they can do things nobody else can. After all, that’s what Leonardo da Vinci would do, right... of course, I call BS.</p>
<p>Lesson number one… And pay attention here because this is one of the most important things anybody at Vertex will ever say to you. Stop swinging for the home runs and start hitting the singles. The basic idea is to stop reaching for the stars and start building from the ground up.</p>
<p>With our firmly planted on the ground, what do we need to create? We could maybe even go a little simpler than that. What do we need to add to our work?</p>
<p>I’ve interviewed hundreds of artists and one of the most important things that they always bring up is "Story". We work in an industry-based around stories. The assets, the characters the environments that we build and animate and destroy all relate to a story.</p>
<p>Importantly, you don’t need to be developing your own stories, per se. It’s not about a unique story unless you’re a director or a writer who is going to pitch something to the studios. In that case, it’s absolutely about a unique story.</p>
<p>In our case, it just has to "Look" like it fits in A story.. any story, really. Like it’s sat in the grass or been exposed to the sun or even been rained on.</p>
<p>A super clean CG model that looks like it could be on turbo squid is not gonna help our case. An antique phone that looks like it’s antique and like its seen the greasy hands of thousands of people Only to sit neglected in a corner for decades is all the story we need. It is also all the story that most aspiring artist forget.</p>
<p>Most aspiring artists fall into the trap of more noise equals more skill. That is so far from the truth. I find myself constantly reminding students to tone down the value variation of their work. To traffic in the subtleties and not the large shifts of color or dark blotches.</p>
<p>Practice the act of squinting at your work. Painters of been doing that for centuries. It helps simplified tones so you can see where you might be overdoing it.</p>
<p>What do we need to remove or reduce?</p>
<p>One of the most important things we need to remove or reduce is work in progress images in our portfolio and simple renders such as ZBrush screen grab or even IRay in substance painter.</p>
<p>Companies are thirsting for artists who understand the complete PBR workflow and can produce results on their own. ZBrush screen grabs might show your sculpting ability but it just places you in competition with the thousands of other ZBrush screen grabs. You need to level up your presentation.</p>
<p>Now, there are a lot more things for us to discuss here but we'll get into them in time.&nbsp; Just think about this next time you see a post from a professional artist. What are they doing that you could do more of to?</p>
