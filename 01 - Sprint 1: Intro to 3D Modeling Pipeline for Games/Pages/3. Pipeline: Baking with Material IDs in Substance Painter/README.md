# 3. Pipeline: Baking with Material IDs in Substance Painter

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In this module we're going to tackle the next step in the pipeline by adding material IDs to our bake. We'll then look at how UV direction affects things like wood grain.</p>
<p>We'll start by looking at Materials in Maya using the Hypershade, and then dive into how we can use those as Material IDs to designate different physical materials on our models.</p>
