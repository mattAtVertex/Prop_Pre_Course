# S1 - Intro to 3D Modeling Pipeline for Games

<h1><span>Overview</span></h1>
<p><span>In this sprint, you will be introduced to the 3D modeling pipeline used in the game industry for props. For the project, you will be working on simple models to more quickly get familiarized with the pipeline process. We will be covering the basics around the high to low poly modeling and baking process.</span></p>

<h2><a title="Assignment 1: Demonstrate the ability to model a crate and barrel" href="https://vertexschool.instructure.com/courses/172/assignments/1657" data-api-endpoint="https://vertexschool.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/172/assignments/1657" data-api-returntype="Assignment"><span>Demonstrate the Ability to Model a Crate and Barrel</span></a></h2>
<h3><strong>Objective</strong></h3>
<p><span>Youâ€™ll start by creating the high resolution meshes, then build a game resolution (or low poly) shell around them. Once the game resolution mesh is unwrapped, you will then bake the model to obtain your primary textures.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Expected Outcome</strong></h3>
<p><span>You will have a game resolution model with high resolution details baked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Stretch Goals</strong></h3>
<p><span>Try adding details to the crate and barrel like extra ornamentation. If you are familiar with ZBrush, try adding sculpted detail to your crate and barrel.</span></p>
