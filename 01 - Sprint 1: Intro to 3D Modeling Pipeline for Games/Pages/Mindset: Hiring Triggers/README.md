# Mindset: Hiring Triggers

<p><span>At Vertex, we believe that traditional education, while not failing per se, is definitely not efficient at preparing you for a job.</span></p>
<p><span>The reason is fairly simple. Traditional education places a premium on knowledge. Companies and people hiring for jobs place a premium on the application of that knowledge, i.e. skill capacity and a proven track record of success.</span></p>
<p><span>The problem that Vertex was built to address is the gap between what an employer wants from you and what you are both aware of and capable of. That means that we solve for two problems:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Awareness</span></li>
<li><span>Capability</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span>Awareness</span></h3>
<p><span>You might be aware of the game industry. You might play games. You might marvel at the environments. However, you might also be completely unaware of how those environments or those characters are created. You might be completely unaware of PBR workflows and how those are implemented in tools like substance painter. You might be unaware of how Houdini is used to create cities in minutes as opposed to months.</span></p>
<p><span>This problem is made worse by the pace at which this industry changes. You might run across a class or tutorial video online that’s only three years old but completely outdated and useless to your career.</span></p>
<p><span>In fact, most videos and content out there aren't really even focused on a career in Creative Tech. Mostly, they are just cool things that you can do with cool software.</span></p>
<p><span>This program is designed to introduce you and make you aware of both the processes and the tools you need to learn to become a job candidate.</span></p>
<p><span>We should take a second and define "Job Candidate". It actually leads us into the next element we need to study.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Capability</h3>
<p><span>In my podcast interview with Gavin Goulden, he mentions that there can be 1000 applications for just one job opening. He also mentions that 600 of those applications are thrown out in the first pass.</span></p>
<p><span>What do those 600 have in common? How can you ensure that you’re not one of those 600? How do you know that your work is good enough?</span></p>
<p><span>This is an endless problem for artists. We love something one day and then wake up in a cold sweat realizing our mistake. We are a river constantly flowing. Our work is a stone that we’ve dragged down that river on our journey. It is always left behind us. We are always, eventually, ahead of it.</span></p>
<p><span>Thankfully, the industry doesn’t really care what we think is good or bad art. There are companies who are desperate to throw money at us. They just need us to do very specific tasks. Not tasks the way we think they should be done or even tasks that we think are important… They are willing to pay us money, but they want us to do the tasks that they want done and to do it their way.</span></p>
<p><span>This is a job, after all. We get to this job through our love of art, but at the end of the day, it is a job that someone is paying us to do. There are criteria that they have. </span><span>We call these criteria "Hiring Triggers".</span></p>
<p><span>Once your work showcases these criteria, then you inch towards becoming a job candidate. These hiring triggers demonstrate your capability to do the job. </span></p>
<p><span><span>Often these criteria are not verbalized by the viewer, even if they are an artist.&nbsp; The viewer might just say, “This is good.” and not be able to elaborate on what “good” is.&nbsp; At Vertex School, we’ve done the work necessary to bring this to light and build a training curriculum to bring creatives out of the dark and give them a roadmap for success.</span></span></p>
<p><span>As I unpack these, I want you to be thinking about someone in HR with two clipboards. One with a checklist of all the things that they are looking for, and another with a checklist of the things they do not want to see.&nbsp; When they’re done looking at your work, they evaluate how many checkmarks they have on both boards and that helps them determine whether or not you are a job candidate.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, if they see a ZBrush screen grab, they make a check on the list of things they don’t want to see. In fact, at that point, they just click on to the next portfolio.</span></p>
<p><span>If the first image they see is rendered in a game engine somewhere around the polygon count they need, then they make a check on the clipboard with things they want to see and keep going.</span></p>
<p><span>Now, they might have had a bad day. They might not feel great about something in their life. They might be rushed because they’re in crunch. So your work might be missed for some reason completely beyond your control. However, for the most part, the process is relatively simple.</span></p>
<p><span>The process is this: make work that they want to see. Make enough of it that they feel comfortable with you. Put that in front of enough people and you will eventually land a job.</span></p>
<p><span>So, what do they want to see? Here ya go:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Criteria Categories</span></h3>

<h3><span>The Eight Questions You Can Ask</span></h3>
<p><span>The hiring triggers that we listed above can be overwhelming, but the important thing to understand is that they can be summarized in a series of questions that viewers are asking themselves when judging your work.</span></p>
<p><span>Here is a brief list of questions that you can ask yourself about your work to help you judge your own work:</span></p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1"><span>In my high resolution, does it match my reference’s shape and size 99%?</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>In my high resolution, did I pay attention to details like the bevels and how the actual prop was constructed in the real-world?</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>In my low resolution, did I spend my polygons on the curvy areas and did I save enough polygons in the flat, straight areas?</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Do my UV’s look like I’m the type of person who throws everything in the closet when a guest comes over… or do they look like I’m the type of person who believes Everything In It’s Place &amp; A Place For Everything (i.e. the closet can not be That place…)?</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Does my material look clean or does it look like it could actually exist in the real world?</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>For my texture / material… did I add a gradient?&nbsp; Did I add roughness variation?</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Does my final render look like I actually gave a crap about the end result or like I was rushing off to In-N-Out for lunch? Remember, think about this from the perspective of someone reviewing hundreds of portfolios in a day.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Does my final render look like I explored how a professional photographer might work?</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span>A VISUAL LOOK AT THE TRIGGERS</span></h2>

<h2><span>MINIMAL CRITERIA FOR CERTIFICATE OF COMPLETION</span></h2>
<p><span>In order to receive your certificate of completion, you’ll need to demonstrate the following tasks.</span></p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1"><span>You’ve completed a high poly mesh with correct bevels</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>You’ve created a low poly mesh that maintains the silhouette but is roughly 20% of the polygon count of the high resolution.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Your texture and material works includes the following</span></li>
<ol>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Color and value variation</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Roughness variation</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Gradients</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Edge effects using Curvature</span></li>
</ol>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Your Render contains at least three lights and clearly illuminates your prop</span></li>
</ol>
<h2><span>SUMMARY</span></h2>
<p><span>Alright, that is a lot of information for you. Our goal was to try to break this down to be as scientific as possible while being cognizant of the fact that it is still an art form, and there are complexities that we might not have verbalized.</span></p>
<p><span>The most important thing is that you, the creator, stay ever focused on the real-world and replicating everything that you can think of.&nbsp; It is not enough to be able to do something fast. It is not enough to be able to use the software.&nbsp; You must be able to replicate reality and achieve a level of realism that stands above and beyond the majority of your peers and acts as a calling card for your abilities.</span></p>
