<p>You made it! You're here. Think of this assignment like a Gear Check before moving onto the big raid. If you can do this, then you've mastered the pipeline for game art.</p>
<p>For this assignment, you will be creating a plank kit (or a similar kit like rocks, blocks, etc) from start to finish, then bringing it into Unreal.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Demonstrate the ability to sculpt wood in ZBrush.</p>
<p><strong>Submission:</strong> Post images on Artist Awake, submit link to the post.</p>

<h2>Exercise</h2>
<p>To create your plank kit, follow this process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create the basic shapes in your 3D software and plan out the UVs to see how many you can make.</li>
<li>Import into ZBrush and sculpt the detail.</li>
<li>Export the decimated planks from ZBrush</li>
<li>Build the game resolution versions.</li>
<li>Bring the plank kit into Unreal Engine.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Stretch Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>Try adding a different size plank and maybe a rope portion into your kit, then create something like a bridge</li>
<li>Try creating a stone block kit as well</li>
<li>Get creative and create another kind of kit using ZBrush</li>
</ul>
