# Review: ZBrush to Game Engine Techniques

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In Part 1, we're going to explore techniques for getting your high poly model out of ZBrush, get a low poly model, getting your material IDs set up so you can texture it, and then getting it into the game engine.</p>
<p>In Parts 2 and 3, we're going to explore the Iteration Workflow and demonstrate how we can always make changes anywhere in the pipeline and always reimport.</p>
