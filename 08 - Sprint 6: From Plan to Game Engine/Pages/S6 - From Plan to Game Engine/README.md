# S6 - From Plan to Game Engine

<h1><span>Overview</span></h1>
<p><span>In this sprint, you’ll be learning how to create a small asset kit. We’ll be covering the process from planning out the number of pieces, then taking it through the high poly sculpting process. Next you’ll get first hand experience on different low poly techniques and their results.</span></p>

<h1><span>Assignment</span></h1>
<h2><span>Create an Asset Kit</span></h2>
<h3><strong>Objective</strong></h3>
<p><span>You will be creating an asset kit from start to finish. You will plan out your UV space and take it all the way through the texturing process. Your final result should be in Unreal Engine.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Expected Outcome</strong></h3>
<p><span>A complete plank (or similar) kit textured and in Unreal Engine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Stretch Goals</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Try adding a different size plank and maybe a rope portion into your kit, then create something like a bridge</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Try creating a stone block kit as well</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Get creative and create another kind of kit using ZBrush</span></li>
</ul>
