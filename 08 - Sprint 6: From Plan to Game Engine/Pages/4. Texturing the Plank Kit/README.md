# 4. Texturing the Plank Kit

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>It's time to texture our planks! In this demo, we're going to bring our planks into Painter and start creating the textures. Some things to remember as we take on this task:</p>
<ul>
<li>When sculpting, we focused on large form details. Things like the wood grain get taken care of in the texturing stage here.</li>
<li>We have both a decimated low poly and a simple low poly; be sure to check the normal map for both!&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
